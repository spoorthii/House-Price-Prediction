Abstract

We are working on a project to predict the sales prices of houses. For each Id in the test set,
we should be able to predict the value of the SalePrice variable. We have retrieved data from 
Kaggle and did EDA, used various regression techniques, applied ensemble Model and also applied 
Neural Network for tensor flow to get the best results.


Introduction

If we ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the 
height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad etc but this dataset
proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.
The main goal of the model used in the paper is to different values for the dependent variable based on
several independent variables by using different regression techniques and then comparing the results and 
their accuracy by RMSE value and plotting the best results.


Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development 
and testing purposes.


Prerequisites
Download and install Python distributed by Anaconda.
Installing Dependencies
The following are commands to install Python packages not included in the list of Anaconda installed packages
which we have used and are Windows-supported, some changes may need to be made in the case of an Apple or a Linux machine:

•	XGBoost - Gradient Boosting
conda install -c conda-forge xgboost  
•	TensorFlow
conda install -c conda-forge tensorflow
